- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @RWayneAustin I Am 63 Yeas old
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in What Happened To Me, Amd on My Linux System Computer The Other Week...
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning Everything I Can To Fix What Happened...
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on Whatever I Can With Whom Ever I Can To Solve This Mystery: 
- I Have Spent The Last Couple Of Weeks In A Linux Version Of The Twilight Zone. I Upgraded My Computer To Ubuntu 22.10. 
- Right After It Was Installed It I Started Watching All Of My Files, My Desktop, My Poems, My Writings, Start Disappearing.
- I Am Only A Fair Novice But I Was Literally Desperate To Not Lose My Files. I Was Given An Error Message I Hope You Guys Can HELP WITH THIS ONE!
- I Literally Went On Line To Every Ubuntu, Linux__ Site, And I Asked My Question "HOW Can I Fix This?" WELL HERE IS THE READOUT I Was Dealing With.
- This Is Still the Same Computer.I Copied And Pasted Every Fix It Patch On Every Site, And I Was Rudely Ejected Out Of My Main User Page, And Into
- My Guest Page, I There Remained For Two And And Half Weeks. And Now My Twilight Zone Invitees, Could We All Just Get On The Same Page?
